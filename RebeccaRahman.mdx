desc: "Hi, I’m Rebecca Rahman, a Bengali Muslim student majoring in Marketing with a passion for creative strategy and analytical thinking. I have a strong academic foundation, thanks in part to dual enrollment, and I’ve excelled in subjects like Business Management, Marketing, Economics & Social Sciences, Psychology, Philosophy, and Religion.
One of my favorite projects was leading A.I. Diva for the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP)—a sassy AI chatbot designed to teach others about proper AI usage in real-world contexts. I’m especially interested in the ethical and practical aspects of AI, including issues like misrepresentation, plagiarism, and false representation.
I love working on projects that connect culture, language, and data. For example, I created a map project exploring the word for mother across European and Asian languages. I’ve also been diving into elasticity problems in agriculture, honing my skills in applied economics.
On the tech side, I’ve been studying computer programming and incorporating it into my academic and creative work. I recently developed a reflective journal in the style of a Scout project proposal and am working on a 10-minute presentation and STaRS poster that summarize my workshop experiences—complete with two pie charts and a bar graph to illustrate my findings.
Also, a fun fact is that my favorite color is baby blue!”
